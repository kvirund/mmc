Source was imported from http://haali.su/mmc/ and modified to make possible to compile with morden Perl.

Compilation on Windows
----------------------

Current sources were tested with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and Perl 5.26.1.

First of all you should change your Perl Makefile. You need to go to your Perl
sources and go to its win32 subdirectory. There is Makefile that you have to
change. I checked the following configuration:

```diff

Now you are ready to build your own Perl. Just open "Developer Command Prompt
for VS2015" and type `nmake`. When everything is built type `nmake install`. I
don't suggest you to perform any testing as I cannot tell you what you should do
in case of this testing is failed.

Also you need to build ZLib. But it seems to me easy enough to don't mention it.
I used ZLib 1.2.8. You can take it here: [ZLib on GitHub](https://github.com/madler/zlib).

Then build `mmc` as usual using CMake. After all, you should copy few files from
your Perl installation to the folder with built mmc executable file:

  - `%PERL_DIR%\bin\perl526.dll` -> `%MMC_DIR%`
  - `%PERL_DIR%\lib\auto\Hash` -> `%MMC_DIR%\lib\perl\auto\`
  - `%PERL_DIR%\lib\auto\List` -> `%MMC_DIR%\lib\perl\auto\`
